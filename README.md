# Sorting Algorithm Comparison

## Project Overview
This repository presents a comprehensive comparison between standard sorting algorithms and custom-developed algorithms. The focus is on evaluating and comparing the performance of these algorithms under a variety of conditions and data sets.

## Performance Comparison
Below is a visual representation of the performance comparison of the sorting algorithms:

## Request for Review
In my analysis, I observed that my custom algorithms appear to outperform the standard algorithms in certain scenarios. I am aware, however, that it is unlikely I have discovered something entirely new in the field of sorting algorithms, which leads me to suspect there may be an oversight in my testing approach.

I would greatly value your expertise in reviewing my implementation and testing procedures. Your insight could help determine whether these results are due to a genuinely efficient algorithm I've developed, or if there are flaws in my testing methodology that have led to these unexpected results.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
